# Direct-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis
## 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes a direct marketing campaign dataset from a Portuguese bank, where clients were contacted via phone to promote term deposit subscriptions. The goal was to identify key patterns and customer characteristics that influence the success of marketing efforts.
## 2. Methodology
Data Import & Preparation:
The dataset was imported from Excel into MySQL.
Data cleaning included checking for nulls, standardizing data types, and ensuring integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed using SQL queries to summarize and segment data by key demographics (age, job, marital status, education).
Created derived variables like Age Group to simplify segmentation.
Data Visualization:
Connected MySQL to Power BI.
Built interactive dashboards using bar charts, pie charts, slicers, and KPIs to visualize campaign performance and client profiles.
## 3. Key Insights
Campaign Outcome:
Only around 11% of clients subscribed to the term deposit.
Age Factor:
Subscription rates were highest among clients aged 50 and above.
Job Role:
Retired and student groups showed significantly higher conversion rates.
Contact Duration:
Longer phone call duration correlated strongly with successful conversions.
Previous Contact:
Clients previously contacted in past campaigns had a slightly higher success rate.
Marital Status & Education:
Single individuals and those with university degrees responded better to the campaign.
## 4. Recommendations
Target Age 50+ Segments:
Focus marketing efforts on older clients, especially retirees.
Refine Call Strategy:
Train agents to spend more time on promising leads — optimize call durations.
Leverage Previous Contacts:
Re-target clients previously contacted but not converted — they show improved responsiveness.
Segmentation Marketing:
Create tailored messaging for students, singles, and educated individuals.
Campaign Timing:
Analyze and optimize the time of day and month for future campaigns based on performance.
